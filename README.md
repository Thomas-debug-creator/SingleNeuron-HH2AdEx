# Single Neuron Models: from HH to AdEx
This project has been realized as part of the Biological Modeling of Neural Networks (BIO-465) course at EPFL.

The main goal was to study the *Adaptation* phenomenon in a biological neuron. Starting from the basic **Hodgkin-Huxley** model, we enriched it with an adaptation current $I_M$ to account for it. Then, we studied the **Adaptive Exponential Integrate and Fire** model, a simpler tool yielding accurate results in this context. We tuned its parameters in order to match the HH neuron, and compared the two models.
